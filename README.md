# Hindi Handwriting Recognition
This code helps you classify different alphabets of Hindi language using Convnets. 
This code successfully recognizes Hindi characters when user draws characters in front of the camera.
## Code Requirements 
Install Conda for python which resolves all the dependencies for machine learning. 
## Technique Used 
I have used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). I have used Tensorflow as the framework and Keras API for providing a high level of abstraction.
## Python Implementation 
1. Dataset - Devnagari Character Dataset 
2. Images of size 32X32
3. Convolution Network Support added. 
## Train Accuracy ~ 99.06%
train on 70000 samples with 15 Epochs 
## Test Accuracy ~ 97.05%
test on 2000 samples 
## Excecution of program 
1. To train the dataset run the file Hindi Handwriting Recognition.ipynb
2. Excecution for writing through webcam run the file Hindi Handwriting Recognition 1.1.ipynb
